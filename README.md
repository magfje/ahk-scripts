## Scripts Included

### auto-closing-brackets.ahk
Auto-inserts closing brackets and quotes (like in code editors). Disables itself in VS Code and Cursor to avoid conflicts.

### auto-codeblock.ahk
Press Shift+` three times quickly to insert a Markdown code block (```) using the clipboard. Great for writing code in chat or notes.

### caps-to-mod.ahk
Turns CapsLock into a powerful modifier for fast app switching:
- `CapsLock + b` for ZenBrowser
- `CapsLock + v` for VS Code (cycles through VS Code and Cursor windows)
- `CapsLock + c` for Claude
- `CapsLock + t` for Windows Terminal
- `CapsLock + o` for Obsidian
- `CapsLock + f` for FilePilot
- `CapsLock + u` for Cursor

**Note:** Edit the configuration section at the top of the script to match your app install locations if needed.
